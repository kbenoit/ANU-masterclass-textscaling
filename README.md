## How to Use

### Cloning the repo

I recommend that you start by cloning the repository to your local system.  You can do this straight from RStudio, using "New Project", then from the New Project Wizard, select "Version Control" as the source, then "Git".  Paste "https://github.com/kbenoit/ANU-masterclass-textscaling" into the "Repository URL:" field.  Choose your preferred local parent directory from the bottom field.  Use the "Create Project" button to create the project and clone the repo locally.

### Refreshing the repo

You will be able to (and should) make local edits to the files that are in the repository.  But as these are updated, or as new files or solutions are added, you will want to pull these from the remote repository and update your local version.

The easiest way to do this is first to commit your local changes, from the Git panel in the Environment pane.  Once these are committed, you will be able to use the Pull button to get the newest versions.
